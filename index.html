									<h2 class="major">Learn python with me</h2>
									<p>When I first came to UCI as an Undeclared/Undecided major I quickly realized the unfair system in place for the major transfer into the school of Information and Computer Sciences.
										After over a year of struggle, I was finally able to switch into an ICS major. </p>
									<p>In effort to alleviate stress and uncertainty from incoming Undeclared/Undecided Freshmen, I created
										an online course to provide these students with introductory ICS material as well as academic advising in order to help them change their majors.</p>
									<p>After teaching 30+ students over multiple 5 week sessions, I am proud to say many of my students have come back to tell me how they were able to easily change their major by
										passing the placement exam which my course had prepared them for.</p>
